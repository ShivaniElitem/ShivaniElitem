ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Shivani!
ðŸŽ“ Senior at The University of Texas at Dallas, pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science along with Certifications in Data Science and Machine Learning
ðŸ”­ Aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer

I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. Iâ€™m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. (Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as a Break Through Tech FellowLinks to an external site.!) Currently, I'm focusing on building machine learning models and diving deeper into data science. Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!

âœ¨ Fun Fact:
A matcha latte is my favorite accessory, and you can find me with it when coding to my favorite Lo-Fi playlist, engaging in fun-yet-charged discussion on AI ethics with my Women in Tech group, or decompressing with a TikTok scroll.
