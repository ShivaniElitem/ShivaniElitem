# üëã Hi, I'm Shivani!

üéì Senior at The University of Texas at Dallas, pursuing a Bachelor's in Computer Science along with Certifications in Data Science and Machine Learning

üî≠ Aspiring Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer

I love tackling real-world problems through data analysis and predictive modeling. I‚Äôm big on continuously learning and building my skills, and I believe taking initiative is key to growth. (Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as a Break Through Tech Fellow.) Currently, I'm focusing on building machine-learning models and diving deeper into data science. I‚Äôm looking to leverage and grow my skills in an early-career job where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!


# üéØ Featured Project: 

## YouTube Viral Video Forecasting

### What We Did:
Developed a machine learning model to predict YouTube video virality using metadata and natural language processing (NLP) of video titles, descriptions, and tags.

### Tools:
- Programming & Platforms: Python, Google Colab, GitHub
- Modeling: Random Forest, TF-IDF Vectorization
- Data Preprocessing: NLTK, one-hot encoding, feature engineering

### Result:
- Identified significant correlations between video attributes (e.g., title length, emotional words, and call-to-action phrases) and virality.
- Improved understanding of how tags, descriptions, and audience interaction metrics influence video performance.
- Achieved robust accuracy in classifying viral vs. non-viral videos.
